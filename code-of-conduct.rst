PHP Project Code of Conduct (CoC)
=================================

Taken from https://github.com/derickr/php-community-health/issues/14:

1. The CoC is to provide community guidelines for creating and enforcing a
   safe, respectful, productive, and collaborative place for any person who is
   willing to contribute in a safe, respectful, productive and collaborative
   way.

2. The CoC is not about being offended. One should always assume good
   intentions. As with any diverse community, anyone can — and probably will —
   get offended at anything.

3. A safe, respectful, productive and collaborative environment is free of
   personal attacks and disparaging remarks of any kind, this includes (but is
   not limited to): level of experience, gender, gender identity and
   expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size,
   race, ethnicity, age, religion, beliefs, politics, and nationality.

4. Any sustained disruption of the collaborative space (mailing lists, wiki,
   bug tracker, official social media accounts) or when representing the PHP
   project shall be construed as a violation of the CoC and appropriate action
   will be taken by the CoC committee.

5. The CoC is only about interaction with the PHP community. Your private and
   public lives outside of the PHP community are your own. However, we reserve
   the right to take your public conduct into account when considering your
   project related conduct.

Encouraged Behaviour
--------------------

Examples of encouraged behaviour include:

- Respectful discourse of disagreements around new features, changes, and
  technical implementations (e.g. discussing any RFC)
- Objective and qualified responses regarding why features or their
  implementations are lacking or otherwise not suitable
- Mentoring of newcomers to the project
- Behave professionally
- Exercise consideration of the many different world views present and be
  respectful in your speech and actions
- Attempt collaboration before conflict, and attempt to improve upon ideas
  presented, rather than dismissing them

Our expectation is that we will treat each other, and others our community
interacts with, with consideration, empathy, and respect. Our speech and
behaviour will be guided by a desire to create and maintain an inclusive
community purposed towards sharing knowledge and encouraging enthusiasm for
solving problems.

Unacceptable Behaviour
----------------------

Examples of unacceptable behaviour by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery
- Personal attacks
- Trolling or insulting/derogatory comments
- Public or private harassment relating to project concerns
- Publishing other's private information, such as physical or electronic
  addresses, without explicit permission (AKA doxing) 
- Coercing other members to vote for a particular option on an RFC, or to
  change or withdraw an RFC
- Other unethical or unprofessional conduct (i.e. anything that would be
  unacceptable in a professional context. Think: conference, not boardroom).

Application of the Code of Conduct
----------------------------------

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviours that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

By adopting this Code of Conduct, project maintainers commit themselves to
fairly and consistently applying these principles to every aspect of managing
this project. Project maintainers who do not follow the Code of Conduct may be
permanently removed from the project team.

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community —
specifically, this means anywhere you are using your @php.net email address
(e.g. via email or on a contact me slide), or are otherwise presenting
yourself as an official representative of the PHP project.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour may be
reported by contacting a project maintainer at codeofconduct@php.net. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated as outlined
[here](#appropriatelink) and will result in a response that is deemed
necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. Maintainers are obligated to
maintain confidentiality with regard to both the reporter of an incident, and
the accused, and expect all parties to assist in ensuring this.

Contributor Guidelines

Mailing List Rules
------------------

From http://git.php.net/?p=php-src.git;a=blob_plain;f=README.MAILINGLIST_RULES;hb=HEAD:

This is the first file you should be reading before doing any posts on PHP
mailinglists. Following these rules is considered imperative to the success of
the PHP project. Therefore expect your contributions to be of much less positive
impact if you do not follow these rules. More importantly you can actually
assume that not following these rules will hurt the PHP project.

PHP is developed through the efforts of a large number of people.
Collaboration is a Good Thing(tm), and mailinglists lets us do this. Thus,
following some basic rules with regards to mailinglist usage will:

   a. Make everybody happier, especially those responsible for developing PHP
      itself.

   b. Help in making sure we all use our time more efficiently.

   c. Prevent you from making a fool of yourself in public.

   d. Increase the general level of good will on planet Earth.


Having said that, here are the organizational rules:

   1. Respect other people working on the project.

   2. Do not post when you are angry. Any post can wait a few hours. Review
      your post after a good breather or a good nights sleep.

   3. Make sure you pick the right mailinglist for your posting. Please review
      the descriptions on the mailinglist overview page
      (http://www.php.net/mailing-lists.php). When in doubt ask a friend or
      someone you trust on IRC.

   4. Make sure you know what you are talking about. PHP is a very large project
      that strives to be very open. The flip side is that the core developers
      are faced with a lot of requests. Make sure that you have done your
      research before posting to the entire developer community.

   5. Patches have a much greater chance of acceptance than just asking the
      PHP developers to implement a feature for you. For one it makes the
      discussion more concrete and it shows that the poster put thought and time
      into the request.

   6. If you are posting to an existing thread, make sure that you know what
      previous posters have said. This is even more important the longer the
      thread is already.

   7. Please configure your email client to use a real name and keep message
      signatures to a maximum of 2 lines if at all necessary.

The next few rules are more some general hints:

1. If you notice that your posting ratio is much higher than that of other
   people, double check the above rules. Try to wait a bit longer before
   sending your replies to give other people more time to digest your answers
   and more importantly give you the opportunity to make sure that you
   aggregate your current position into a single mail instead of multiple
   ones.
2. Consider taking a step back from a very active thread now and then. Maybe
   talking to some friends and fellow developers will help in understanding
   the other opinions better.
3. Do not top post. Place your answer underneath anyone you wish to quote
   and remove any previous comment that is not relevant to your post.
4. Do not high-jack threads, by bringing up entirely new topics. Please
   create an entirely new thread copying anything you wish to quote into the
   new thread.



Mailing List Posting Guidelines
-------------------------------

From http://php.net/mailing-lists.php:

When posting to mailing lists or newsgroups, please keep the following in mind:

- Use a valid email address. Every new poster's email address is checked for validity through confirmation.
- Send plain ASCII messages, no HTML-formatted emails please.
- Turn on word wrapping so your entire message doesn't show up on a single line.
- Be sure to click Reply-All to reply to list. Clicking Reply will email the author of the message privately.
- No attachments please, just post a URL if you want someone to look at something.
- Don't GPG/PGP sign your messages. If you want people to be able to send you encrypted email, stick your key-locator in your signature
- Don't hijack other peoples' threads. To post on a new topic, start a new message, don't reply and just change the subject.
- Check the archives before posting a question, chances are it has already been asked and answered a few times.
- When asking a question, don't just tell us, "it doesn't work". Tell us what you are trying to accomplish, a short code snippet showing how you tried to solve it, what you expected to get and what you got instead.


Constructive Collaboration Guidelines
-------------------------------------

This section presents a loose collection of guidelines that focus on
encouraging constructive feedback on language proposals (RFCs). RFCs are  used
to introduce new features into the language. Currently, too little time is
focussed on improving RFCs; instead a lot of effort exists to torpedo RFCs,
attack suggestions and opinions. The point of the RFC process to to
**improve** PHP — and the RFCs themselves.

Below are several suggestions:

* In general, don't send more than one post per hour about a single topic. Do not "rapid-fire" reply to the active topic, but instead take the time to compose and edit the reply containing all the information you wanted to convey.
* Write clear and unambiguous prose. It is better to be descriptive than to be concise.
* Write as much as is necessary, but as little as you can get away with. 
* Suggest improvements to the RFC, don't just shoot it down. When disagreeing, provide substantial reason instead of just saying "no". Try to outline specific points you disagree with and suggest ways of improvement. And remember, you can suggest improvements to an RFC even if you would not vote to support the RFC.
* Don't use hyperbole to defend your arguments.
* Don't send a "quick email", especially during a heated debate.
* Think before you send "reply". Consider how the other party is likely to feel with the content. And, how you would feel if the same text was directed at you. Emotions are important and difficult, especially when you have never met in person.
* Debate the technical issues, and never attack a person's opinion. People will disagree, so be it.
